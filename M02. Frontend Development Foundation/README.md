# Frontend Development Foundation

## Frontend Development Introduction
### What is Frontend Development?
Front-end web development, also known as `client-side development` is the practice of producing `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` for `a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly`.

### What are the challenges?
The challenge associated with front end development is that the `tools` and `techniques` used `to create the front end of a website change constantly` and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.

A website or web application which relies on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript commonly runs in a `Web Browser` but can also run in a `Headless Browser`, `WebView`, or `Native App` as compilation input for a native runtime environment.

### The Web platform
The Web platform is `a collection of technologies developed as open standards` by the World Wide Web Consortium and other standardization bodies such as the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group, the Unicode Consortium, the Internet Engineering Task Force, and Ecma International.

The Web platform includes technologies—`computer languages` and `APIs`—that were originally created in relation to the publication of Web pages.

This includes HTML, CSS, SVG, MathML, WAI-ARIA, ECMAScript, WebGL, Web Storage, Indexed Database API, Web Components, WebAssembly, WebGPU, Web Workers, WebSocket, Geolocation API, Server-Sent Events, DOM Events, Media Fragments, XMLHttpRequest, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, File API, RDFa, WOFF, HTTP, TLS 1.2, and IRI.

## Modern Web Application
### New technologies
- Transpliers - BabelJS
- CSS Preprocessor - SASS, SCSS, and LESS
- JavaScript Libraries
- Module bundler - Webpack, Browserify
- . . .

### Single Page Application
A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app.

### Functional Programming Paradigm
- Composition
- Declarative
- Purity
- Immutability
