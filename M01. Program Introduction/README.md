### Building team's project
Students will be grouped in a team (3-5 people) with different knowledge background. Each team has to find their idea to build software application applying the knowledge that they learnt from the course, or even beyond that. This is the great chance to practice both engineering skills and soft skills (working in group, presentation,...) to sharpen your profile.

Our vision is to "bridge the gap between theory and practice", so students are encouraged to apply latest technologies, tools and methods to develop their real-world skills and enhance their experience throughout self-learning, knowledge sharing, mentoring.

Happy building!
